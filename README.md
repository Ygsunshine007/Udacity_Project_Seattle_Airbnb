The Libraries That I Have Used
The project was implemented using Anaconda distribution of Python 3.0. Moreover I have used the following python libraries:

My Project Motivation
I was interested in exploring the AirBnB dataset for Seattle. I wanted to better understand the pricing trends, review sentiments and pricing prediction. 

File Descriptions
The Jupyter notebook showcases the analysis done in order to explore the dataset, the data prepartion and wrangling as well as the building of prediction models in order to answer the questions above. The notebook contains markdown cells to help with documentation of the steps as well as to communicate findings based on each analysis.

For reference an HTML version of the notebook is also available.

Lastly, the seattle folder contains the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). It contains 3 files:

<li>calendar.csv: calendar availability of listings and price</li>
<li>listings.csv: information about all the available listings</li>
<li>reviews.csv: listing reviews by the users</li>

I wrote a blog about my findings on the following questions:
<li>Who are the top performers in Airbnb business?</li>
<li>What listing features are highly correlated to the listing performance?</li>
<li>What are the advices a landlord can take to improve their listing performances?</li>
<li>Which neighbourhood has higher listing prices for investors to consider?</li>
